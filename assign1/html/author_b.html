					<p class="biography"><strong>Biography</strong>: New Orleanian Tom Sancton was the longtime Paris Bureau Chief for Time magazine, where he wrote more than 50 cover stories. He has also written for Vanity Fair, Fortune, and other leading magazines. In 1998, he co-authored the international bestseller Death of a Princess (St. Martin’s), on the circumstances surrounding Princess Diana’s death. His latest work, The Bettencourt Affair (Dutton), describes the scandal surrounding the world’s richest woman, L’Oréal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, 94, and the much younger protégé on whom she bestowed nearly a billion dollars—until Liliane’s daughter sued him for elder abuse. A Rhodes Scholar who studied at Harvard and Oxford, Sancton has taught creative writing at Tulane University and now lives mainly in France. Under the stage name Tommy Sancton, he is also a well-known jazz clarinetist with more than a dozen albums to his credit. In 2014, the French government named him a Chevalier (Knight) in the Order of Arts and Letters.</p>

				<h3>The Bettencourt Affair: The World's Richest Woman and the Scandal That Rocked Paris</h3>
				<p>The Bettencourt Affair started as a family drama but quickly became a massive scandal, uncovering L’Oréal’s shadowy corporate history and buried World War II secrets. From the Right Bank mansions to the Left Bank artist havens; and from the Bettencourts’ servant quarters to the office of President Nicolas Sarkozy; all of Paris was shaken by the blockbuster case, the shocking reversals, and the surprising final victim.<br>It all began when Liliane met François-Marie Banier, an artist and photographer who was, in his youth, the toast of Paris and a protégé of Salvador Dalí. Over the next two decades, Banier was given hundreds of millions of dollars in gifts, cash, and insurance policies by Liliane. What, exactly, was their relationship? It wasn’t clear, least of all to Liliane’s daughter and only child, Françoise, who became suspicious of Banier’s motives and filed a lawsuit against him. But Banier has a far different story to tell...</p>

								<p>Although this tale seems destined for HBO or Hollywood, to bill this a mere 'family drama' belies the staggering depth with which Sancton portrays his subjects, whose motivations, desires, and downfalls are 'so difficult to judge according to a moral code based on right and wrong, black and white, good and evil.' A natural for book clubs, which will drain a French cellar’s worth of wine while appreciating Sancton’s meticulous research and discussing this unbelievable cast of characters.</p>

								<p>This book has it all! Money, class, art, greed, intrigue, seduction, betrayal, and politics. It reads like a novel -- a racy and intense thriller -- but it's all true. With amazing reporting and wonderful writing, Tom Sancton brings alive the drama of the richest woman in the world, the powerful minister she married, their intellectual daughter, and the audacious artist who may have siphoned off a fortune. Their battles shook France and will fascinate readers.</p>

				<h3>Death of a Princess: The True Story Behind Diana's Tragic End</h3>
				<p>For the twentieth anniversary of Diana's death, a new, updated edition of the headline-grabbing New York Times bestseller that told the definitive story of how the Princess of Wales lost her life in a high-speed car accident in the heart of Paris on August 31, 1997.<br>

What really happened on that fateful summer night? Rumors still abound: that Diana and her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed (son of wealthy Egyptian businessman Mohamed Al Fayed), were planning to marry and British intelligence was somehow involved in their deaths. Or, that the paparazzi, a second car, or Diana and Dodi's driver, may have been responsible.</p>

								<p>Princess Diana, most definitely, married for love, however "The Firm" were absolutely cold & downright cruel to this young woman. They chose her for only one reason to produce "the heir & his spare". Prince Charles was a wimp following Daddy's orders. It was heartbreaking to read of her walking down the aisle on what should have been the happiest day of her only to see her husband's lover in the crowd. She must have been crushed but in love determined to try to make it work. And you will NEVER convince me that Prince Philip was not involved in her death.</p>

				<h3>Song for My Fathers: A New Orleans Story in Black and White</h3>
				<p>Song for My Fathers is the story of a young white boy driven by a consuming passion to learn the music and ways of a group of aging black jazzmen in the twilight years of the segregation era. Contemporaries of Louis Armstrong, most of them had played in local obscurity until Preservation Hall launched a nationwide revival of interest in traditional jazz. They called themselves “the mens.” And they welcomed the young apprentice into their ranks.</p>

								<p>I am a frequent visitor to New Orleans. The city is a cultural home to me with family from Louisiana. I am also a fan of trad jazz. The music Tom plays and writes about here. The "young musicians" he refers to as assuming the mantel of the men in the book are the people I routinely go to see play. So that made me love the book. </p>

								<p>This is not your ordinary memoir. Tom Sancton gives a history of traditional New Orleans jazz, takes you inside the music and, equally important, inside the culture. He writes from both an insider's perspective and as an outsider. This is no dry chronology, but a lyrical, beautifully written tribute to the "mens", the heart of the music and the soul of New Orleans.</p>

								<p>This book was recommended by a New Orleans native a few weeks before going to JazzFest. It was perfect. It gave me a feel for the city, the history of Jazz and it's relationship to all the cultural, political, and societal changes in the last 150 years. And now I'm going to see Tom Sancton's band play!</p>

								<p>I enjoyed it, very well written and holds your interest. I did not really know what to expect since the cover and title are quite a change from what we normally see from this writer. The story starts out as a story of unrequited love, but soon turns into a mystery that draws you in and keeps you puzzled and interested until the end.Renee Pawlish has again provided a story that I can recommend to anyone.</p>

								<p>The girl in the window is a misfit, possibly a stalker, and she covets her neighbor's husband, but is she a killer? I found this psychological suspense novel intriguing and hard to put down before the end. This was a successful diversion for Renee Pawlish from her two popular popular private eye series.</p>

								<p>Good story. Started a tad bit slow but was worth the read. I like this new direction that Ms. Pawlish has started in. Still a bit of detecting in this one but so much more to the story. Totally worth your time and momey!</p>
