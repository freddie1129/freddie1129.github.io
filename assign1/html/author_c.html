                            <h3>Rediscovering Americanism: And the Tyranny of Progressivism</h3>
                            <p>In Rediscovering Americanism, Mark R. Levin revisits the founders’ warnings about the perils of overreach by the federal government and concludes that the men who created our country would be outraged and disappointed to see where we've ended up.<br>

                                Levin returns to the impassioned question he's explored in each of his bestselling books: How do we save our exceptional country? Because our values are in such a precarious state, he argues that a restoration to the essential truths on which our country was founded has never been more urgent. Understanding these principles, in Levin’s words, can “serve as the antidote to tyrannical regimes and governments.” Rediscovering Americanism is not an exercise in nostalgia, but an appeal to his fellow citizens to reverse course.</p>

I'm 29 years old and have been searching for the most reliable expert on the mirco and macrocosm of societies and ideologies, for over ten years of my life. I've listened to Mark for the last five years and everything he delivers to his listens and viewers has come to fruition and proven to be spot-on-accurate. </p>

By no means comprehensive, it will help you understand the basics and show you the way to do further research (if you choose) so that you do not need to merely take his word for it of how progressive-ism in the past 100+ years has slowly eroded away the foundations America was formed upon and how we might be able to save it yet.</p>

                            <p>When nationally syndicated radio host Mark R. Levin’s Liberty and Tyranny appeared in the early months of the Obama presidency, Americans responded by making his clarion call for a new era in conservatism a #1 New York Times bestseller for an astounding twelve weeks. As provocative, well-reasoned, robust, and informed as his on-air commentary, with his love of our country and the legacy of our Founding Fathers reflected on every page, Levin’s galvanizing narrative provides a philosophical, historical, and practical framework for revitalizing the conservative vision and ensuring the preservation of American society.</p>

Younger people must find the personal strength and will to break through the cycle of statist manipulation, unrelenting emotional overtures, and the pressure of groupthink, which are humbling, dispiriting, and absorbing them; to stand up against the heavy hand of centralized government, which if left unabated will assuredly condemn them to economic and societal calamity.</p>

                                        <p>What I love about Levin’s Plunder and Deceit is its philosophical breadth and panoramic sweep...best of all, Levin respects young readers enough to shoot straight with them...Authentic, sagacious, and written in a philosophical tenor that sometimes soars to operatic heights, Plunder and Deceit is an important work to be read by all and bequeathed to America’s rising generation.</p>

                            <h3>Men in Black: How the Supreme Court Is Destroying America</h3>
                            <p>Conservative talk radio host, lawyer, frequent National Review contributor and author of Rediscovering Americanism Mark R. Levin comes out firing against the United States Supreme Court in Men in Black, accusing the institution of corrupting the ideals of America's founding fathers. The court, in Levin's estimation, pursues an ideology-based activist agenda that oversteps its authority within the government. Levin examines several decisions in the court's history to illustrate his point, beginning with the landmark Marbury v. Madison case, wherein the court granted itself the power to declare acts of the other branches of government unconstitutional. He devotes later chapters to other key cases culminating in modern issues such as same-sex marriage and the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill. Like effective attorneys do, Levin packs in copious research material and delivers his points with tremendous vigor, excoriating the justices for instances where he feels strict constit utional constructivism gave way to biased interpretation. But Levin's definition of "activism" seems inconsistent. In the case of McCain-Feingold, the court declined to rule on a bill already passed by congress and signed by the president, but Levin, who thinks the bill violates the First Amendment, still accuses them of activism even when they were actually passive. To his talk-radio listeners, Levin's hard-charging style and dire warnings of the court's direction will strike a resonant tone of alarm, though the hyperbole may be a bit off-putting to the uninitiated. As an attack on the vagaries of decisions rendered by the Supreme Court and on some current justices, Men in Black scores points and will likely lead sympathetic juries to conviction. </p>
