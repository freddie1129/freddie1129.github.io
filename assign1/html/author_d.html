                            <h3>Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</h3>
                            <p>Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code—of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.</p>

                                        <p>I've been programming about 17 years and consider myself above average programmer. Yet, this book made me feel like I'm actually horrible coder. I've always gotten my tasks done but I didn't pay attention on refactoring to clean up the code. I'm already behind and got a demo coming up in few days. As I'm reading my guilty verdicts on all his 'bad code' examples, it inspire me to care about 'coding' yet again. It can be fun and it's not all about getting the job done. What's sad about the reality is that 'bad code' will continually increase over time because people don't realize what 'bad code' can do in the long run.</p>

It looks fine on my Kindle 3 (aside from using proportional fonts in code examples, but this isn't too bad once you get used to it). Also, as many other reviewers have pointed out, this is an excellent book. I really wish all of my colleagues, predecessors, and managers had read it. My job would be so much easier and more enjoyable if they had.</p>

                            <h3>Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices</h3>
                            <p>Written by a software developer for software developers, this book is a unique collection of the latest software development methods. The author includes OOD, UML, Design Patterns, Agile and XP methods with a detailed description of a complete software design for reusable programs in C++ and Java. Using a practical, problem-solving approach, it shows how to develop an object-oriented application—from the early stages of analysis, through the low-level design and into the implementation. Walks readers through the designer's thoughts — showing the errors, blind alleys, and creative insights that occur throughout the software design process. The book covers: Statics and Dynamics; Principles of Class Design; Complexity Management; Principles of Package Design; Analysis and Design; Patterns and Paradigm Crossings. </p>

The book introduces real-life examples with real codes that greatly improves my understanding of the pattern and the value to use them.</p>

                                        <p>After reading this text, I feel it deserves the attention of other great texts such as Design patterns and Refactoring, even though much of it's content expounds upon the ideas of these two classics. It's my opinion that this text has two strong points: it explains the ideas and details of agile development very clearly, and it does an excellent job of explaining the most popular patterns originated by GOF, plus a few more. The authors style was very good, with most of the examples in Java. Being a C++ programmer, I would have liked to see more examples in that language, but this is not any fault of the author.</p>

                            <p>With More C++ Gems, Robert Martin, Editor-in-Chief of C++ Report, presents the long-awaited follow-up to C++ Gems (1996). Since the publication of the first book, the C++ language has experienced many changes. The ISO has adopted a standard for the language and its library. The Unified Modeling Language has affected software development in C++, and Java has changed things as well. Through all of these developments, C++ Report has been the forum for developers and programmers to share their experience and discuss new directions for the industry. More C++ Gems picks up where the first book left off, presenting tips, tricks, proven strategies, easy-to-follow techniques, and usable source code by some of the most renowned experts in the field.</p>

                                        <p>This book contains a number of very useful columns from the recently deceased C++ report. I found particularly useful the articles on implementation of assignment operators, exception safety, and the inner workings of the standard library containers (Gillan, Austern, Sutter). Actually, they are all really about exception safety - clues on how to write robust code that I needed to learn.</p>

                            <p>For senior/graduate level courses on Object Oriented Design using C++, and the Booch (BC) - OOD book. A practical, problem-solving approach to the fundamental concepts of Object Oriented Design and their application using C++. This book is written for the "engineer in the trenches". It is a serious guide for practitioners of Object-Oriented design. The style is narrative, and accessible for the beginner, and yet the topics are covered in enough depth to be relevant to the consumate designer. The principles of OOD explained, one by one, and then demonstrated with numerous examples and case studies.</p>

                                        <p>This book is the first attempt by Robert Martin to condense his OO design ideas to one spot. Since this book, he's done two more that have the same topic but use Java and C#. While the other two have far more mature thinking behind them, this book presents a number of topics for people new or hostile to OOP. His later books assume you believe OO is right and true.</p>

                                        <p>The information is dated as it was written prior to UML adoption. So much of the text about Booch diagrams is really not all that helpful, but the thought processes behind the design techniques are still valid.</p>
