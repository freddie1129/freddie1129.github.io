                            <h3>The Lying Game: A Novel</h3>
                            <p>From the instant New York Times bestselling author of blockbuster thrillers In a Dark, Dark Wood and The Woman in Cabin 10 comes Ruth Ware’s chilling new novel, The Lying Game.

                                On a cool June morning, a woman is walking her dog in the idyllic coastal village of Salten along a tidal estuary known as the Reach. Before she can stop him, the dog charges into the water to retrieve what first appears to be a wayward stick, but to her horror, turns out to be something much more sinister...

                                The next morning, three women in and around London—Fatima, Thea, and Isabel—receive the text they had always hoped would NEVER come, from the fourth in their formerly inseparable clique, Kate, that says only, “I need you.”

                                The four girls were best friends at Salten, a second rate boarding school set near the cliffs of the English Channel. Each different in their own way, the four became inseparable and were notorious for playing the Lying Game, telling lies at every turn to both fellow boarders and faculty, with varying states of serious and flippant nature that were disturbing enough to ensure that everyone steered clear of them. The myriad and complicated rules of the game are strict: no lying to each other—ever. Bail on the lie when it becomes clear it is about to be found out. But their little game had consequences, and the girls were all expelled in their final year of school under mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of the school’s eccentric art teacher, Ambrose (who also happens to be Kate’s father).

                                Atmospheric, twisty, and with just the right amount of chill that will keep you wrong-footed—which has now become Ruth Ware’s signature style—The Lying Game is sure to be her next big bestseller. Another unputdownable thriller from the Agatha Christie of our time.</p>

                                        <p>If you love psychological suspense, you're going to love Ruth Ware's novels. Her third book, The Lying Game has just released and yes, I loved it!<br>

                                            Isa, Kate, Thea and Fatima all attended the same seaside boarding school. While there, they played what they called The Lying Game. They lied to everyone but adhered to the one rule they laid down - never lie to each other. But their game and their time together abruptly comes to an end when something tragic occurs. Expelled and split up, they go their own ways, except Kate, who stays in Salten. Now grown with careers and families, they only sporadically stay in touch. But, when Kate sends a text with the words 'I need you' to the other three, they immediately come back to Salten. You see, the past can only stay buried so long - and an omission is as good as a lie....</p>

                                        <p>“The Lying Game” is the third novel by Ruth Ware, the British writer who is the author of two previous books which are also in the genre of psychological crime thrillers. The story line of “The Lying Game” centers around four young women, Kate, Fatima, Thea, and Isa, who were classmates and best friends at Salten, a British boarding school near the cliffs of the English Channel. During their tenure at Salten, these girls had concocted an ill-advised recreational activity known as “The Lying Game,” which involved the continual telling of lies to their classmates and faculty, along with the deceit and subterfuge that were required to maintain and perpetuate these fabrications. Not surprisingly, this misguided lying game ended very badly, after a mysterious scandal resulted in their expulsion from the Salten boarding school. Years later, when these young women are in their early thirties, their long-standing secret is suddenly at risk of being revealed, after a long period of dormancy. A sinister discovery in the waters of the tidal estuary known as the Reach threatens to expose the misdeeds of their shared past at the Salten boarding school. This prompts the transmission of a cryptic text from the only member of this formerly inseparable clique who had remained in Salten, sent to her three former classmates and collaborators, who are now living in the London area. This enigmatic text triggers a sequence of events that forms the basis for the story line of this very atmospheric and riveting novel. “The Lying Game” is an intriguing, suspenseful, and captivating psychological crime thriller, which is decidedly well-written, and difficult to put down. I found “The Lying Game” to be a great summer read, which definitely merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.</p>

                            <h3>The Woman in Cabin 10</h3>
                            <p>From New York Times bestselling author of the “twisty-mystery” (Vulture) novel In a Dark, Dark Wood, comes The Woman in Cabin 10, an equally suspenseful and haunting novel from Ruth Ware—this time, set at sea.<br> <br>

                                In this tightly wound, enthralling story reminiscent of Agatha Christie’s works, Lo Blacklock, a journalist who writes for a travel magazine, has just been given the assignment of a lifetime: a week on a luxury cruise with only a handful of cabins. The sky is clear, the waters calm, and the veneered, select guests jovial as the exclusive cruise ship, the Aurora, begins her voyage in the picturesque North Sea. At first, Lo’s stay is nothing but pleasant: the cabins are plush, the dinner parties are sparkling, and the guests are elegant. But as the week wears on, frigid winds whip the deck, gray skies fall, and Lo witnesses what she can only describe as a dark and terrifying nightmare: a woman being thrown overboard. The problem? All passengers remain accounted for—and so, the ship sails on as if nothing has happened, despite Lo’s desperate attempts to convey that something (or someone) has gone terribly, terribly wrong…</p>

                                        <p>Your friend-- let’s call her Debbie Downer-- is a claustrophobic, alcoholic, neurotic insomniac. She’s also a total screwup at her job, and honestly, not very bright. Her house was just broken into so you’re trying to cut her a break, but her nonstop complaining— it’s too hot, it’s too cold, the ceilings are too low, the room’s too small, my clothes smell, I’m too sleepy, I’m too hungry, I’m not hungry, I’m hungover, etc.— is getting to you. Plus there’s the counting to herself (One, Two, Three…!) and the constant, random weeping. She’s a hot mess.<br>

                                            Would you want to spend a lot of time hanging around her? Well, if you can stand to spend 352 pages with her, then you’ll love Lo Blacklock, the protagonist of this book.<br>

                                            I won’t go into a plot synopsis, others have done that already. I managed to solve the “mystery” 66% into the book (I’m on a Kindle), so kudos to the author for making the plot two-thirds difficult. As a reader it’s no fun being more clever than the protagonist.The only mystery to me was how the author was going to fill the other 33% of the book.</p>

It could easily be condensed into a short story if all the repetitious fretting and complaining of the "heroine" were eliminated. Just can't say how bad I found the writing to be - like the product of a high school creative writing class! The protagonist was, for me, unlikeable - self-involved, self-pitying, weak and scatter-brained. Awful!</p>

The repetition (alcohol, pills, anxiety, hangover - WE GET IT ALREADY!) is torture. Chapter 28 and I still can't figure out why there is such a myriad of characters that aren't contributing a thing to the story. Torture, but I'll plug along to the end. Can't imagine anything happening to boost this to even a 2 star review.</p>

                            <h3>In a Dark Dark Wood</h3>
                            <p>When literature student Anastasia Steele goes to interview young entrepreneur Christian Grey, she encounters a man who is beautiful, brilliant, and intimidating. The unworldly, innocent Ana is startled to realize she wants this man and, despite his enigmatic reserve, finds she is desperate to get close to him. Unable to resist Ana’s quiet beauty, wit, and independent spirit, Grey admits he wants her, too—but on his own terms. 
                                Shocked yet thrilled by Grey’s singular erotic tastes, Ana hesitates. For all the trappings of success—his multinational businesses, his vast wealth, his loving family—Grey is a man tormented by demons and consumed by the need to control. When the couple embarks on a daring, passionately physical affair, Ana discovers Christian Grey’s secrets and explores her own dark desires.
                                This book is intended for mature audiences.</p>

                                        <p>This book failed to live up to the hype. I was expecting an exciting thriller but found the plot quite contrived and at times juvenile (especially the tea scene near the end). Never fun to read a book where you've figured most of it out halfway through and have to wait for the heroine to catch on. Some mildly suspenseful scenes but not a bit scary (despite what Reese Witherspoon claims). Still waiting for the next Gone Girl or The Girl on the Train!</p>

                                        <p>I enjoyed it, very well written and holds your interest. I did not really know what to expect since the cover and title are quite a change from what we normally see from this writer. The story starts out as a story of unrequited love, but soon turns into a mystery that draws you in and keeps you puzzled and interested until the end.Renee Pawlish has again provided a story that I can recommend to anyone.</p>
