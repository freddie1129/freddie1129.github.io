		<p class="figtext">Fig 1 Tree-Shrew Publishing Logo</p>
		<p>This logo depicts a small boat sailing in the sea. The string “Tree-Shrew Publishing” in this logo can be understood as a wind to push the boat. The elegant boat design makes the boat looks like a yacht or a boat loading books, representing the authors and their books. To emphasize the importance of “Tree-Shrew Publishing” company and make a deep first impression to web visitors, the first letter “T” is colored as red. <br><strong>The Logo design Photoshop file is attached in submission</strong>.</p>

				<p class="figtext">Fig 2 Website Hierarchy</p>
		<h3>3) Responsive webpage design</h3>

		<img class="authorImage" src="../images/responsive.png" alt="hierarchy">
		<p class="figtext">Fig 3 Responsive Webpage Demo</p>
		<p>The main technique to implement the responsive webpage is grid-view design. For large size items shown on the screen, like images, percentage size is used in css instead of the fixed size value. The horizontal layout sections would become vertical layout sections when the screen’s width is less than 786px. The ccs code related to responsive webpage is show as below:</p>
		<pre>
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
/*responsive Design*/
.row::after {
    content: "";
    clear: both;
    display: table;
}
[class*="col-"] {
    float: left;
    padding: 5px;
	margin-right:0px;
}
.col-1 {width: 8.33%;}
.col-2 {width: 16.66%;}
.col-3 {width: 25%;}
.col-4 {width: 33.33%;}
.col-5 {width: 41.66%;}
.col-6 {width: 50%;}
.col-7 {width: 58.33%;}
.col-8 {width: 66.66%;}
.col-9 {width: 75%;}
.col-10 {width: 83.33%;}
.col-11 {width: 91.66%;}
.col-12 {width: 100%;}

@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
    /* For mobile phones: */
    [class*="col-"] {
        width: 100%;
    }
