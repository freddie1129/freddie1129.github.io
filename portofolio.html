    Nomergy Wellness App Projects
    Client: Nomergy Wellness
    There are 11 Apps have been published in Play Store based on projects, such as Snap Fitness App, Nomergy Fitness App, 9Round Fitness App,
    Listen to Your Body Fitness App and so on. The number of the published Apps is still increasing with the marketing progress. The highlight of this project is that we maintain a serial of different UI style Apps in Play store with the same
    repository.
    This project is handed over to me about one month later after its commencement, then I started to be responsible for all development things, from coding,
    publishing, to maintaining.
